This site is a collection of our resources from the _Best Practices for MOOC Video_ talk at [Learning @ Scale][las] 2014.

The best place to start would be at our [demo page]({{ site.url }}/demo) which has the slides and background info from our demo, as well as all the files we used to make it happen.

All of the materials can be downloaded as a [zip archive][zip].

A link to our 2-page overview paper is [here][paper].
